# music_generation_using_deep_learning

Our focus here is to take some existing music data and then train a model using this existing
data. The model has to learn the patterns in music that we humans enjoy and like. Once the
model learns this, it should be able to generate new music for us. It cannot simply copy-paste
from the training data. It has to understand the patterns of music to generate new music. 

We here are not expecting our model to generate new music which is of professional quality, but
we want it to generate a decent quality music which should be melodious and good to hear. 

though it can be implemented in many ways but we have done it using LSTM.
